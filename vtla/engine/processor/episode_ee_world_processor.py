"""Inference-only postprocessor step: episode-relative EE action -> world-frame EE action.

When a policy is trained with ``action_mode='relative_ee'`` the postprocessor chain ends with
``AbsoluteActionsProcessorStep`` (pose mode), which recovers the action expressed relative to the
episode's FIRST frame (``S_{t+k} = T0^{-1}·T_{t+k}``). To command the robot we still need the
absolute world pose ``A_{t+k} = A0 · S_{t+k}``, where ``A0`` is the world-frame EE pose at episode
start.

This step performs that final ``ee_to_absolute(A0, action)`` lift. It reads ``A0`` live from the
paired :class:`EpisodeEEPreprocessorStep` (which computes and caches it from the first joint
observation of each episode), so the two stay in lock-step across ``reset()`` at episode boundaries.

It is injected by ``make_pre_post_processors`` (inference path only, see
``vtla/frameworks/factory.py``) and is never serialized into a checkpoint — the live reference to
the preprocessor step is not persistable.
