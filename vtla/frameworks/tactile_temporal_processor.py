"""Inference-time processor that assembles tactile temporal windows.

At *training* time the LeRobot dataset delivers tactile keys as windowed
``[B, F, C, H, W]`` tensors directly (the factory's per-key delta_timestamps
handles this).  At *inference* time the robot provides one frame per camera per
step, so this processor maintains a per-key deque of the required depth and
stacks frames into the ``[1, F, C, H, W]`` shape the model expects.

Key behaviour:
- **No-op at training** (tensor already 5-D) — the step detects whether the
  input is already windowed and passes it through unchanged.
- **No-op when F == 1** — single-frame mode; the step is a pure pass-through.
- **Episode-safe** — call ``reset()`` when the robot resets between episodes to
  flush stale frames; the deque re-initialises by repeating the first frame.
